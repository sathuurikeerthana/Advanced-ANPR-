# üöó Vehicle Classification
Usage

This project performs comprehensive vehicle detection and recognition using advanced object detection algorithms. The primary features include:

    Object Detection: Identifies various types of vehicles such as buses, cars, trucks, etc.
    Make and Model Recognition: Determines the make and model of the detected vehicles.
    Color Detection: Detects the color of the vehicles.
    Probability Assessment: Provides a probability score indicating the confidence level of the detections.
    Frame Saving: Saves frames from the video where vehicles are detected.
    Vehicle Coordinates: Records the coordinates of each detected vehicle in the frame.

To use this project, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed and follow the instructions provided in the setup guide. Run the main script with the appropriate video input, and the system will process the video to detect and recognize vehicles according to the features listed above.
