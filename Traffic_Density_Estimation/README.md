# üöó Real-Time Traffic Density Estimation with YOLOv8
This project harnesses the power of YOLOv8's real-time detection capabilities to tackle Traffic Density Estimation, a crucial aspect of urban and traffic management systems. The primary objective is to accurately count vehicles within designated areas in video frames to evaluate traffic flow. The insights garnered from this data are instrumental in pinpointing peak traffic times, identifying bottlenecks, and aiding urban planning. We have crafted an extensive toolkit that provides in-depth analysis of traffic patterns, thereby augmenting traffic control and city planning endeavors.


# 1Ô∏è‚É£. Initial Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the project repository to your local system using the command below:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FarzadNekouee/YOLOv8_Traffic_Density_Estimation.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: After cloning, change into the project directory with:
    ```bash
    cd YOLOv8_Traffic_Density_Estimation
3. **Install Ultralytics YOLO**: Ensure you have the `ultralytics` package installed by running:
    ```bash
    pip install ultralytics
    ```
4. **Run the Analysis Script**: Execute the script to start the real-time traffic density estimation:
    ```bash
    python3 potrait_traffic_estimation.py
    python main.py
    ```
5. **Real-Time Analysis**: The video window will save the live traffic analysis.
